## Overview
The Eight Puzzle Problem is a popular puzzle that is played on a 3x3 board.  Each block is labeled a number from 1 to 8.  The goal is to move the blocks until they are all in order.  We have implemented 3 search algorithms (Uniform Cost Search, A* Misplaced Tiles, and A* Euclidean Distance) to use and analyzed the complexities of each.

## Instructions
- To begin, enter “1” to use a default puzzle or “2” to enter a puzzle of your own.
- If 1 is selected, type 1 to use UCS, 2 for A* with Misplaced Tile heuristic, or 3 for A* with Euclidean distance heuristic. The search algorithm will then begin.
- If 2 is selected, enter your puzzle size N (NXN).
   - Enter each row of your puzzle separately; use a 0 to denote the blank piece and separate each piece with a space.
   - Next, type 1 to use UCS, 2 for A* with Misplaced Tile heuristic, or 3 for A* with Euclidean distance heuristic. The search algorithm will then begin.
