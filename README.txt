* To begin, enter “1” to use a default puzzle or “2” to enter a puzzle of your own.
* If 1 is selected, type 1 to use UCS, 2 for A* with Misplaced Tile heuristic, or 3 for A* with Euclidean distance heuristic. The search algorithm will then begin.
* If 2 is selected, enter your puzzle size N (NXN).
   * Enter each row of your puzzle separately; use a 0 to denote the blank piece and separate each piece with a space.
   * Next, type 1 to use UCS, 2 for A* with Misplaced Tile heuristic, or 3 for A* with Euclidean distance heuristic. The search algorithm will then begin.
